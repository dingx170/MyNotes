# Miscellaneous Notes

**S3 bucket**

"S3 bucket policies \(as the name would imply\) only control access to S3 resources, whereas IAM policies can specify nearly any AWS action. One of the neat things about AWS is that you can actually apply both IAM policies and S3 bucket policies simultaneously, with the ultimate authorization being the least-privilege union of all the permissions."

**Naming**

The name of class and function must be specific and descriptive.
